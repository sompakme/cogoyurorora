Founder Kate Spade wasn't around to see how the bag once again became an instant bestseller, with many iterations of the bag selling out and ending up at sites like Tradesy at ridiculous prices. She wasn't around because of her untimely death, and we raise a glass to her for her ingenious designs.</p><p>Spade first launched her eponymous label in 1993 to create the perfect handbag. At first, she sold six different bags, but one of them, the Sam bag, became an instant success for the modern women who wanted a stylish bag that was reasonably priced. The boxy black bag has evolved over the years, and is now offered in different designs, materials, and colors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, the brand consists not just of bags, but also ready-to-wear, shoes, kitchen items, stationery, jewelry, and much more. It also sells furniture. Spade's design style is often called "whimsical" and, as you'll see, that's true to the brand. Pieces like a dinosaur-shaped bag and a desk with a polka-dot design make the brand fun and stylish. But such twee products come at a price. The dinosaur bag costs $1400.&nbsp; Six drinking draws costs $15. The one thing that all Kate Spade products have in common is their lofty price. Most of us can't afford the line, so we've offered 30 of the most expensive pieces from Kate Spade only the 1 percent can afford so we can see how the other half live.</p><h2 id=the-sam-bag---600>The Sam Bag - $600</h2><p>PurseBlog</p><p>This year, Kate Spade re-released its <a href=#>Sam tote</a> for its 25th anniversary. This boxy nylon bag in black became the first "It" bag that women coveted because it was so stylish yet simple in design. The waterproof tote literally made Kate Spade the designer an overnight success in the nineties. Selling for under $250 now, those who love the iconic bag are now paying a<a href=#> whopping $600</a> to get the original. We still have ours, and we'll leave the rich to get their hands on the original.

Bringing in a color like this will be an eye-opener to your room, but its classic design with a linen fabric and a frame made from Russian birch means you don't have to change pieces to make the sofa fit with your design. But when the price starts at around $6,000 and goes up to $9,000+ depending on the color and the material, we'll leave this couch to the one-percent who can afford it.

Made from smooth calf leather and 14 karat gold plated hardware, the bag comes in a fun lilac cream color. It's feminine and young at heart at the same time, but at $1,410, that's really unreasonable, especially if your friends think you've gone nuts and believe you're carrying your little daughter's handbag.

They come in different sizes and can be used to hold everything from your tech accessories to your stationery sets. We also use it to keep our jewelry in one place.&nbsp;The best thing is that the boxes are gold colored and look very expensive. But the large one is only $20.99 and there are additional colors. So it comes&nbsp;as a surprise that <a href=#>Kate Spade</a> makes the same kind of box (but in polka dots, not in solid colors) for $120. $120 vs&nbsp;$20? Which one would you pick?

That's because of its classic look. But once again, only Bunny Williams would buy this chair, as it costs $2,240. We can buy a full couch with that kind of money!

But at $3,365, we once again have to pass. We found a similar desk at <a href=#>Jonathan Adler</a> but without the polka dots.

A rarity, this is a piece of fashion history. With its signature pale pink color from crocodile, it has 14K gold-plated hardware. The bag is two looks in one, working as either a handbag or a clutch if you rotate the inside of the bag. Here the KS whimsy is in full effect here too, with the engraved word "DAY" when you use the handle and "EVENING" when you convert the baguette into a clutch.

It also has two blackened mahogany drawers and a central open area to perhaps store copy paper. The shiny brass knobs are what identifies this as a Kate Spade desk: they're floral in shape.
