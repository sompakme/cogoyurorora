Neither has an origin film of their own, despite having backstories wound together by years of spy-work and time as agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Both characters were introduced in other solo films with only Black Widow playing anything remotely resembling a supporting role before&nbsp;The Avengers. Hawkeye himself was relegated to a cameo in&nbsp;Thor, but&nbsp;they've managed to build a meaningful relationship nonetheless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Nat making the ultimate sacrifice in the last film, it seems it'll be hard for their friendship to be explored any further. However, there is still a Black Widow solo movie in the works, so that might give more screen time for these beloved heroes.</p><p>Until we know more about the Black Widow project, here are <strong>20 Wild Revelations About Black Widow And Hawkeye's Relationship</strong>.</p><h2 id=neither-have-superpowers><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><strong>Neither Have Superpowers</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/black-widow-and-hawkeye-powers.png><p>Even though most of the Avengers have been amped up by serums, created by super-geniuses, are mutants, etc., Black Widow and Hawkeye have no advantages of the sort. They don't even get a fantastic tech suits like War Machine or Iron Man. They just are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the people they just "are" do have exceptional marksmanship and top-tier assassin abilities. They aren't the most flashy heroes, but they have fantastic stealth and infiltration capabilities. As on-hand agents, they help The Avengers get their high-priority missions finished.</p><p>Considering Hawkeye brought Black Widow into S.H.I.E.L.D., the pair have been together through their entire careers. Superpowers or not, they've supported each other into becoming great heroes.</p><h2 id=they-both-date-around-in-the-comics><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><strong>They Both Date Around (In The Comics)</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/black-widow-hawkeye-bucky.jpg><p>Even though Hawkeye and Black Widow started their comic run romantically entangled, they didn't stay that way.

If the creators were doing it on purpose, the guy really has a thing for bugs and birds.</p><p>Black Widow's dating pool was far more prolific, consisting of Captain America, The Winter Soldier, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and more. Before comics focused more on her awesome skills, she was better known for being a catch.</p><p>Either way, they've both lived long and rich romantic lives in the comics, falling in love and breaking hearts.</p><h2 id=they-almost-married><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>They Almost Married&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/black-widow-and-hawkeye-marriage.jpeg><p>Before they went on to date other people, Black Widow and Hawkeye were madly in love.

Side by side, they completely changed each other's lives.</p><p>However, the pair weren't meant to be. Shortly after getting engaged, Black Widow had to break his heart to fulfill an important mission. When she finally returned to the team, their relationship was officially donezo and they haven't been anything more than friends in a long time.</p><h2 id=both-have-been-criminals-before><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Both Have Been Criminals Before</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hawkeye-ronin.jpg><p>While many Avengers started off wholesome and good, Hawkeye and Black Widow weren't like that. Widow was manipulated by the USSR to become a perfect assassin, and she manipulated Hawkeye to try to defeat Iron Man. They both were turned into awful people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With time, though, Hawkeye eventually left behind the life of crime to do some good in the world. And Widow? He convinced her to try out being a hero. After they became do-gooders, neither hero went back.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, their ex-criminal lives didn't quite disappear.

It only proves the strength of their relationship and how close they are as friends.</p><h2 id=black-widow-saves-hawkeye-from-loki><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Black Widow Saves Hawkeye From Loki</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/black-widow-and-hawkeye-fight.jpg><p>During the first Avengers movie, Loki tried to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. by enslaving the minds of several of its members. This includes Hawkeye, a top S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

They're both ex-criminals with a lot of problems and some tragic backstories. Moreover, though, they just don't seem to have the time for that kind of thing in most stories. They are full-time Avengers, after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In movies or animation, however, it's a different story. Most obvious, in the MCU, Clint has an entire family. He has a wife, two kids, and another on the way. He's a very serious family man, quitting being a full-time Avenger to be with them.</p><p>Though it's a rare case, in Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow, Black Widow has a son with Captain America, named James Rogers. He leads the young heroes against evil.</p><h2 id=hawkeye-doesn-t-believe-in-taking-lives-she-does><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Hawkeye Doesn't Believe In Taking Lives (She Does)&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Black-Widow.jpg><p>One of Hawkeye's most important tenets is that he doesn't believe in taking lives. Well, save a few creatures and those time he goes Ronin dark. Even during his time as a villain, he refused to cause much bloodshed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the flips side, Black Widow has been putting people in their graves since she was a young girl. It was what she was trained to do. When she grows older and can choose her morals, she still walks the line of hero and anti-hero.

However, after his entire family is snapped, he initially shirks rejoining the Avengers in favor of turning bloody vigilante.</p><p>This is hardly Hawkeye's first time&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;the team.

Before Hulk, she dated the likes of Tony Stark, one of the brightest men on the planet.
