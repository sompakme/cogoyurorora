Unfortunately, their <b>website</b> is not working, and there have been no updates on their Facebook page since September 2017. This lack of online presence raises doubts about whether the company is still <b>operating</b>.</p><p>Without an actively functioning <b>website</b> and <b>social media</b> accounts, it becomes challenging to assess the current state of Coffee Joulies. Their absence from these platforms leaves customers and enthusiasts with little information about their products, updates, or any potential new releases. <b>Operating</b> in the digital age, maintaining an online presence is crucial to engage with customers and build brand loyalty.</p><p>While the specific reason behind Coffee Joulies’ inactive website and <b>social media</b> is unknown, it is important to note that businesses can undergo changes over time.

These beans are not your ordinary coffee accessory – they are embedded with a <b>phase-change material</b> (PCM) that allows for precise <b>temperature control</b>.</p><p>When placed in a hot cup of coffee, the PCM inside the Coffee Joulies absorbs the excess heat, rapidly cooling down the beverage. This process ensures that your coffee reaches the ideal drinking temperature quickly, preventing any burnt tongues.</p><p>Once the coffee reaches the desired temperature, the <b>phase-change material</b> solidifies, effectively trapping the heat within the Coffee Joulies. As a result, the stored heat is gradually released back into the coffee, effectively maintaining the perfect temperature for a longer period.</p><p>By harnessing the principles of heat absorption and release, Coffee Joulies provide a consistent and enjoyable coffee-drinking experience. Whether you prefer your coffee piping hot or lukewarm, these innovative beans allow you to savor each sip at your desired temperature.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Coffee-Joulies-Temperature-Control-1024x585.jpg alt="Coffee Joulies Temperature Control" title="Coffee Joulies Temperature Control" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Coffee Joulies have truly revolutionized the way we enjoy our coffee. With their <b>temperature control</b> capabilities, you can say goodbye to scalded tongues and lukewarm brews. It’s like having a personal barista in your cup!” – Coffee enthusiast</p><p>With Coffee Joulies, you can experience the true essence of your coffee – from the moment it’s brewed to the last sip. No more rushing to finish your coffee before it gets cold, or wasting precious time constantly reheating your cup.</p><h3>The Science Behind Coffee Joulies</h3><p>At the heart of Coffee Joulies is the incredible power of <b>phase-change material</b>. This material has the ability to absorb and release large amounts of heat without undergoing a significant temperature change. The PCM inside the Coffee Joulies functions as a thermal battery, providing controlled heat management.</p><p>When the Coffee Joulies are exposed to a hot beverage, the phase-change material transitions from solid to liquid state, absorbing the excess heat and cooling down the coffee. As the coffee cools, the PCM solidifies again, slowly releasing the stored heat and maintaining the optimal temperature.</p><p>This ingenious mechanism allows Coffee Joulies to keep your coffee warm for extended periods, ensuring that every sip is as enjoyable as the first.</p><table><tr><th>Key Features of Coffee Joulies</th><th>Benefits</th></tr><tr><td><b>Temperature control</b></td><td>Maintain the perfect temperature for longer</td></tr><tr><td>Phase-change material</td><td>Utilize the power of heat absorption and release</td></tr><tr><td>Stainless steel construction</td><td>Durable and long-lasting</td></tr><tr><td>Reusable</td><td><b>Eco-friendly</b> alternative to disposable coffee accessories</td></tr></table><h2>Reusability and Eco-Friendliness of Coffee Joulies</h2><p>Coffee Joulies are not only a convenient way to keep your coffee at the perfect temperature, but they are also a sustainable and <b>eco-friendly</b> option for coffee lovers.
