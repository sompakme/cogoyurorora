They would rather set their sights on their new job becoming a good mother. With the joys of pregnancy also come the cons of pregnancy, the weight gain and your body bending out of its regular shape. Hollywood can put a lot of pressure on all its actresses to be back in shape soon after the birth of their children. Why? The jury is still out on that one. However, these actresses do not let that faze them one bit. All of them have better things to focus on, some on motherhood and some on finding a balance between working and motherhood. If you work on several sets after having children, it can become difficult to jump back into the work pool and leave your newborn for weeks at a time. However, there are comprises that can be made some actresses take their children on set with them. While others decide, the set is not worth it and leave it behind. After giving birth to a child Hollywood can sometimes become more critical of the performances. They want to see if the passion of being a mother will interfere with their passion for work. Almost as if it is a competition but for these ladies there is not competition family comes first, but there can be time to work as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=comeback-megan-fox><strong>Comeback:&nbsp;Megan Fox</strong></h2><p>Dark-haired bombshell Megan Fox was not ready to give up the big screen when it came to going back to work after she gave birth. The actress currently has three children, Noah, Bodhi, and Journey with husband Brian Austin Green. Fox took a two-year break after having first son Noah Green, but she came back with as April in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The 32-year-old actress made it clear in an interview with E News that her family is a priority. Despite putting her family first, she has still made time to work on movies and is currently working on multiple projects, including the new movie Zeroville.</p><p><strong>“It’s exhausting, but it’s amazing and you can’t, until you have kids, you can’t imagine how much you could possibly love a human being. It’s really intense and really overwhelming and amazing.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fox also gives credit to her husband of eight years saying that he helps her with their morning routine and making sure there is food on the table, especially while she is filming. The pair are said to have opposite parenting styles and that can cause chaos at home. While the model prefers a “free-spirited” parenting style and doesn’t like them watching television or in front of screen, while dad would like to have more structure and rules in place.</p><h2 id=comeback-anne-hathaway><strong>Comeback:&nbsp;Anne Hathaway</strong></h2><p>Much like her character in Devil Wears Prada, Anne Hathaway did not let pregnancy slow her down from hitting the big screen. In 2016, the Oscar winner and husband Adam Shulman had their first and only child a son named Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman. When did the Alice in Wonderland actress have time to have a child and work on several projects. Since the birth of her child she has sparked a new interest in advocating for parental rights, such as paid maternity leave and gender equality.&nbsp;Hathaway&nbsp;has loved every moment of motherhood saying, “I don’t need to be a perfect mom to be a good mom.” Even while pregnant the star continued to work, she starred in the film Colossal in her earlier stages.
