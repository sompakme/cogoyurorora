They not only receive a salary for their work as part of the yacht crew, but they also keep their tips from guests and receive a production fee from the show. These various streams of income combined make up the cast members’ earnings and play a significant role in their financial success.</p><p>Working as part of the yacht crew provides the cast members with a base salary. While the exact figures may vary depending on their roles and experience, second and third stews typically earn around $5,000 per month and up to $50,000 per charter season. Chief stews, such as Hannah Ferrier and Kate Chastain, can earn up to $6,000 per month and $75,000 per charter season. Chefs have the potential to make $7,000 to $10,000 per month and up to $95,000 per charter season. The captain, who holds the highest-paid position, can make up to $210,000 per season, with an average salary ranging between $120,000 and $150,000.</p><p>In addition to their salaries, the cast members also benefit from <b>guest tips</b>. These tips are a significant source of income and can amount to thousands of dollars per charter. The cast members often receive generous tips from satisfied guests, and these earnings supplement their salaries, contributing to their overall <b>net worth</b>. The total amount of tips earned can vary depending on the season and the guests’ satisfaction with the crew’s service.</p><h3>Earnings Overview</h3><table><tr><th>Yacht Crew Role</th><th>Monthly Salary</th><th>Charter Season Earnings</th></tr><tr><td>Second and Third Stews</td><td>$5,000</td><td>Up to $50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Chief Stews</td><td>$6,000</td><td>Up to $75,000</td></tr><tr><td>Chefs</td><td>$7,000 – $10,000</td><td>Up to $95,000</td></tr><tr><td>Captain</td><td>Up to $210,000</td><td>Average $120,000 – $150,000</td></tr></table><p>“Being part of the Below Deck Mediterranean crew means earning money from several sources. Our salaries as yacht crew members provide a solid foundation, but it’s the tips from our guests that can really boost our earnings. Plus, being part of a popular reality TV show like Below Deck Mediterranean comes with additional perks, such as a production fee. It all adds up to create a diverse and rewarding income stream.” – Below Deck Mediterranean cast member</p><h2>Eddie Lucas Speaks Out About Pay</h2><p><b>Eddie Lucas</b>, a former cast member of Below Deck Mediterranean, recently opened up about the salaries of the cast on the popular <b>Bravo TV show</b>. In an interview, Lucas expressed his frustration with the pay disparity between Below Deck and other Bravo reality shows, particularly The Real Housewives series. Despite putting in similar hours and effort, cast members on Below Deck Mediterranean earn significantly less compared to their counterparts on The Real Housewives.</p><p>Lucas emphasized that while the cast members on Below Deck Mediterranean may be the lowest-paid on Bravo, they still earn more than the average yacht crew member. It’s worth noting that the cast members’ salaries on Below Deck Mediterranean are supplemented by tips from guests and their involvement in the reality series. However, the disparity in pay between different Bravo shows remains a point of contention for the cast.</p><p>“It’s frustrating to see the pay difference between Below Deck and other Bravo shows. The Real Housewives cast members make more money for doing less work,” said Lucas in the interview.</p><p>Despite the lower salaries, being part of Below Deck Mediterranean has its benefits. Cast members have the opportunity to work on luxury yachts, travel to exotic locations, and gain exposure on a popular TV show. This exposure can lead to other career opportunities and potentially increase their earning potential in the long run.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Eddie-Lucas-1024x585.jpg alt="Eddie Lucas" title="Eddie Lucas" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><b>Eddie Lucas</b> speaking out about the pay disparity sheds light on an ongoing issue within the reality TV industry. While fans may enjoy watching the drama unfold on their screens, it is important to remember that the cast members are real people who deserve fair compensation for their hard work and contributions to the show.</p><h2>Guest Tips as Income Boosters</h2><p>One of the significant sources of income for Below Deck Mediterranean cast members is the generous tips they receive from guests. These <b>guest tips</b> play a crucial role in boosting the cast members’ overall earnings and contributing to their <b>net worth</b>. Throughout each charter season, the cast members have the opportunity to earn thousands of dollars in tips, making a significant impact on their financial success.</p><p>Guest tips are a reflection of the guests’ satisfaction with the crew’s service and the overall experience on the yacht. Typically, guests tip a percentage of the total charter fee, which can sometimes amount to a substantial sum. The cast members work diligently to provide exceptional service, ensuring that the guests have a memorable and enjoyable time onboard.</p><p>As the cast members strive to exceed expectations and create unforgettable experiences for their guests, they can earn tips that range from hundreds to thousands of dollars per charter.
