Moretz is now 21 years old and has already dipped her toe into the modelling world, been voted one of the 25 most influential&nbsp;teens in the world and publicly supported equality as well as revealing that she was a feminist. Even though she has been around the acting business now for more than a decade, Moretz has the mind of someone much older than her and on many occasions, she has turned down roles that she has been offered because she didn't want to be objectified.</p><p>It seems that Chloe has been around for much longer than she actually has and in that time she has been the main part of some incredible movies where she has been able to share the screen with the likes of Zac Efron and Johnny Depp. The young actress has definitely left her mark, so much so that she is now able to inspire a number of other women to follow in her footsteps and copy her style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chloe has grown up into a stunning young woman over the past few years and with this she has been able to wear much&nbsp;more daring outfits. The following list looks at just 20 times that the actress has given us much more than we could handle.</p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-let-the-hollywood-pressure-get-to-her>She Doesn't Let The Hollywood Pressure Get To Her</h2><p>There are so many women in Hollywood right now who have grown up in the spotlight and allowed the pressure of life in front of the cameras to get to them. Luckily, Chloe Moretz has remained completely focused on her career and hasn't had any kind of bad publicity go her way over the past few years.</p><p>At 21 years old, she has managed to overcome her most awkward years in the public eye, so it could now be&nbsp;smooth sailing for the former child star. Chloe deserves to relax and take a break as she is seen doing here on the diving board of a pool, which looks like it's from a scene that she was part of in Bad Neighbours.&nbsp;This film also stars Zac Efron, who Chloe has managed to become close friends with while working together on both Bad Neighbours&nbsp;and its sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-a-risk-taker>She Is A Risk-Taker</h2><p>The celebrity world is now populated with women who are only able to share their style with the world and they think that is enough to make them famous. Chloe isn't the kind of star who has cared that much about fashion, but she does have a background in modelling.</p><p>Chloe's image has remained pretty much the same ever since she made her debut in Hollywood more than 14 years ago. All she has done is grown older&nbsp;and on the odd occasion, she has decided to change up her hair. The above image shows the actress trying out braided hair, which actually suits her. Are there any hairstyles that she couldn't rock? Chloe could definitely&nbsp;benefit from trying out many more fun hairstyles if she wanted to. It would be interesting to see her change her style now that she's old enough to move on to riskier roles.</p><h2 id=she-goes-for-complex-roles-and-doesn-t-want-to-be-objectified>She Goes For Complex Roles And Doesn't Want To Be Objectified</h2><p>Chloe has stated throughout her career that she has turned down many of the roles that she has been offered because she thought that the characters were being objectified. She isn't a woman who has ever had to use her beauty as part of a role. Chloe has always been able to land roles and portray characters so well because she has a talent for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As she's gotten older, it's obvious that the star has grown into her beauty and now she has become a role model for many little girls who want a career much like hers. Chloe has avoided all of the bad avenues that come with her fame and this has allowed her to always remain true to herself and then control the characters that she wants to portray as well. Chloe is happy to be able to control her own fate based on her beliefs.</p><h2 id=she-has-already-been-in-the-business-for-14-years>She Has Already Been In The Business For 14 Years</h2><p>Photoshoots are obviously one of the side effects of having a job in the spotlight and since Chloe has been doing it now for around 14 years, she knows that when she's part of a film, she will&nbsp;also be forced to be part of all of the press release for that film.</p><p>The good thing about the actress is the fact that she changes her appearance so subtly when she is portraying a character that more often than not it is hard to tell who she is. At just 21 years old she has quite a resume so far, which shows that she definitely has a bright future ahead of her.&nbsp;It will be interesting to see if she is one of the women picking up an Oscar in the coming years as her popularity continues to rise and she continues to push herself forward in her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-wants-to-stand-out-from-the-crowd>She Wants To Stand Out From The Crowd</h2><p>There are so many actresses or celebrities who decide that the only way to remain relevant in Hollywood is to take off your clothes for a role, but Chloe has never allowed herself to go in that direction. Chloe knows that she is naturally beautiful and that she can be completely subtle in everything she does because that only adds to her overall charm.</p><p>Moretz is a very smart girl and she has figured out how to have a long career in the spotlight without having to follow in the footsteps of the women before her. This is why she is considered to be one of the most influential teens in the world, even though she isn't a teenager anymore.</p><h2 id=she-made-it-in-hollywood-without-any-connections>She Made It In Hollywood Without Any Connections</h2><p>Even though Chloe managed to break into the business when she was only seven years old, it wasn't because she had family members who were able to help her make any kind of impression. Chloe's mother Teri is a nurse and her father is a surgeon, which means that they had their own career paths mapped out for their daughter but she decided to write her own story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress also has four older brothers and it was her brother Trevor who was first accepted to Performing Arts School, where Chloe would help him to learn his lines. This was the thing that first sparked her interest in the acting world and then led to her following that path instead of one that her parents perhaps would have preferred. Incredibly, it was only a few years later that she was able to make an impression in Hollywood, which is often unheard of without family ties.</p><h2 id=her-older-brother-helped-her-pursue-an-acting-career>Her Older Brother Helped Her Pursue An Acting Career</h2><p>Chloe's older brother Trevor was the one who helped her to pursue the career that she desired by teaching her the acting techniques that he was learning at school. Chloe was able to then use these and with the help of her family attended a number of auditions to see if she could apply these skills in a professional setting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though her brother was the one who first wanted to pursue a career in the acting business, he has now become Chloe's acting coach and even accompanies her on the road when her parents can't. Much like many child stars, she didn't like being on the road without her family, so more often than not they would come with her. Her natural acting ability and beauty are just some of the reasons why the actress has been able to rise so quickly in the acting world.</p><h2 id=she-has-model-potential>She Has Model Potential</h2><p>With looks as perfect as Chloe's, it was obvious that at some point she would have to make a splash in the world of modelling as well. The actress has taken part in a number of photoshoots and features for many of the biggest fashion magazines, which have allowed her to appear on the cover of the magazines like Flaunt, Vogue, Marie Claire, Elle, and InStyle.</p><p>In 2012 she was able to land a contract that allowed her to become the face of&nbsp;American youth clothing retailer Aéropostale, which has allowed her to attend a number of events that promote the brand. She has never been seen as a style icon like many of the stars who are on the same level as her, but she was awarded the "Next Future Icon Award" at the Elle Style Awards back in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-got-her-first-break-when-she-was-seven>She Got Her First Break When She Was&nbsp;Seven</h2><p>After Chloe attended a number of auditions, she was given her first big break when she was just seven years old as she appeared in the CBS series The Guardian, this then later led to her first film role in Heart of the Beholder.</p><p>Obviously, this was just the beginning for Chloe, who didn't get her real recognition until the following year when she was cast in The Amityville Horror in 2005. This was when she finally gained some recognition and was seen as a potential star in the acting world. This role even allowed her to bag a Young Artist Award nomination. It was this film that then catapulted her into the position where she was able to land a number of much bigger roles after this, including Big Momma's House and a number of guest roles in TV series that allowed her to gain some wider attention.</p><h2 id=she-has-a-heart-of-gold>She Has A Heart Of Gold</h2><p>Chloe was&nbsp;referred to as "the busiest actress in Hollywood" when she was just 13 years old because she had been able to pick up so many roles in her short time on the scene.&nbsp;Just six years after she first got her break in The Amityville Horror, Chloe was making waves in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress landed a number of roles series like My Friends Tigger & Pooh,&nbsp;where she voiced Darby&nbsp;and Sherri Maltby in Desperate Housewives all of which she was able to be seen as a recurring character. Alongside these Tv characters, the youngster was also making an impact in the world of movies too where she was becoming more and more popular and gaining a fanbase of her own, something that she has always used to her advantage when it comes to promoting some of the biggest causes that she supports, which shows that she has a heart of gold.</p><h2 id=she-takes-her-acting-work-very-seriously>She Takes Her Acting Work Very Seriously</h2><p>It's been hard for Chloe to have any kinds of relationships in her career because she is always in the public eye and there is a lot of pressure on her and the people who are attached to her at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to maintain a clear divide between her professional life and her private life, Chloe doesn't allow her friends to come on to any sets when she is filming or the premieres of any of her movies. The actress feels as though it is much easier for her to relax if she knows that her friends aren't around when she's working because outside of the business she is then able to have fun with her friends. This is something that not many celebrities her age are able to do, but this is another example of how much more mature Chloe is than her age would have you believe, which has worked out well for her throughout her career.</p><h2 id=she-is-an-animal-lover>She Is An Animal Lover</h2><p>Chloe doesn't have a lot of personal relationships because of how high profile her job is, but the actress has been able to maintain quite a simple relationship with her animals. It was a heartbreaking month for Chloe back in August 2017 when she announced on Instagram that her dog Fuller had sadly passed away.</p><p>Just a few weeks later, the star once again shared that her other dog Isabella had also passed away. It seems as though she hasn't had a lot of luck with her animals, but it shows that she has a big heart and has continued to look after animals over the past year. She has since welcomed an adorable puppy Pug called Ruby and shared a number of updates of her dog called Pearl, who she takes on movie sets with her so she has to have her own private dog walkers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-met-brooklyn-beckham-when-she-was-17>She Met Brooklyn Beckham When She Was 17</h2><p>Given her obvious natural beauty, it's a shock that Chloe Grace Moretz hasn't been in more public relationships over the past few years. Her most high profile was when she was dating Brooklyn Beckham. The&nbsp;two&nbsp;met at Paris Fashion Week back in 2014 before they were then photographed out skating together a few months later.</p><p>Moretz was just 17&nbsp;years old when she met the son of David Beckham and the couple has been dating on and off ever since. There were hints of an engagement before the couple then split and Chloe herself even said that she felt like hiding from the world after the couple decided to go their separate ways. Luckily, the&nbsp;two have since rekindled their romance and are now one of the most envied couples in the celebrity world and also one of the cutest to follow on Instagram.</p><h2 id=she-is-not-like-other-child-stars>She Is Not Like Other Child Stars</h2><p>It has already been mentioned that Chloe turned down a number of roles when she was younger because she thought they were characters that were being objectified. The actress has never been one to dress up and attempt to use her beauty to get ahead, but there are a number of images of her online that show that she does dress up every now and then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moretz has been able to remain on a solid road throughout her career. She has never ended up in rehab like a number of other child stars when they began to get older and resent the spotlight and the life they have created for themselves. Chloe is different. She is smart enough to keep her personal and private life separate and has always ensured that there isn't anything leaked to the public that she doesn't want the world to know.</p><h2 id=she-is-close-to-her-family>She Is Close To Her Family</h2><p>At 21 years old, Chloe Grace Moretz has already ensured that she has left a lasting impression on the acting world. Even though she landed the role of Ryan Reynold's daughter in The Amityville Horror when she was just six years old, she was so young that her mother refused to allow her to watch the film when it actually premiered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chloe's parents have helped her so much throughout her career, but this could have come at a price since the&nbsp;two have now divorced. Her brother Trevor has also given up his hopes of an acting career so that he can work with his sister full-time and travel around looking after her, which has probably become quite a fun road trip for the&nbsp;two over the past few years. Chloe also has three other brothers called Brandon, Col, and Ethan, who shy away from the acting world.</p><h2 id=she-lied-to-get-the-role-in-hugo>She Lied To Get The Role In Hugo</h2><p>One of Moretz's biggest films to date was Hugo, which was nominated for more than eleven awards and was considered to be one of the best films of the year. At the point that Chloe went to audition for the movie, she was already a rising star, but she had heard that director Martin Scorsese wanted a British person for the role, so she pretended to be British for the audition. When she actually got&nbsp;the role she then had to admit that she wasn't the British star that he was looking for.</p><p>The director didn't have any problems with the fact that Chloe had lied about her&nbsp;nationality in order to achieve the part since he allowed her to remain part of the cast and it is still one of the biggest movies that she has been part of. It's incredible to think that someone like Moretz thought she would have to lie to gain the role in a movie, despite all she had already achieved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-acted-alongside-johnny-depp>She Acted Alongside Johnny Depp</h2><p>As well as Hugo, another movie that Chloe was part of in her younger years was Kick-A*s, the star has a thing for iconic roles and she became Hit Girl in the superhero style movie. Chloe was just 13 years old when she was part of the original movie and 16 when she made the sequel, but her age was never an issue since she was one of the stars who stood out throughout the movie. After Kick-A*s, Chloe went on to star in a number of high profile movies, including Dark Shadows alongside Johnny Depp. The movie failed to be as successful as it was predicted to be, but at least the actress can say that she has shared the screen with one of the all-time greats, and was probably able to learn a thing or two.</p><h2 id=she-proved-that-she-could-be-a-star-in-the-remake-of-carrie>She Proved That She Could Be A Star In The Remake Of Carrie</h2><p>Carrie is one of the biggest movies that Chloe has been part of in her career since it was a remake of the original horror film&nbsp;that centered around a high school outcast who is sheltered by her deeply religious mother and then uses her telekinetic powers on a number of her peers after a prank goes wrong. Carrie was released back in 2013 when Moretz was just 16 years old and proved that she was destined to be a huge star in the business in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film received mixed reviews and was thought to have been a remake that no one really asked for, but Moretz stepped into the role quite well and even though she herself was unable to attend high school like a normal teenager, she was able to adapt to the role the way her director thought she would and was one of the reasons the film was a success.</p><h2 id=she-stays-in-great-shape>She Stays In Great Shape</h2><p>It's hard to believe that Chloe has any spare time at all given how much work she does in the acting world, but she likes to have some time to herself to spend with her friends as well as finding time for her hobbies.</p><p>Chloe likes swimming and basketball and in order to prepare for her role as Hit-Girl in Kick-A*s, she took&nbsp;gymnastics, body conditioning, and weapons training. Gymnastics is something that Chloe has always had an interest in and it has helped her to land a number of roles and to stay in incredible shape. It is possible to have a high profile career and still find time for yourself since Chloe has been able to do it for years. Maybe that's the secret to having a lengthy career,&nbsp;which has allowed her to remain on top for so long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-considered-for-the-role-of-katniss-in-hunger-games>She Was Considered For The Role Of Katniss In Hunger Games</h2><p>Even though Moretz is now considered to be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood&nbsp;in her age range, she has still had her own fair share of setbacks. It doesn't matter how big a star you are, there will always be movies that don't fit. Moretz auditioned for Case 39 and even ran lines with Renee Zellweger before the part of Lillith went to Jodelle Ferland.</p><p>The actress was also one of the stars who was considered for the role of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but that was instead given to Jennifer Lawrence and went on to kickstart her entire career. Of course, Chloe hasn't allowed these setbacks to affect her. The actress has already starred in more than 40 movies to date and will only continue to&nbsp;climb when it comes to popularity and her positive mental attitude could be one of the biggest reasons for this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGLBqrnErGScoJyksm6z0ZqanmWdpL%2BmwNlmnpqulWLCtHnTqKZmpaWYtW7AzmafmqaUobJw</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f20-times-chloe-grace-moretz-gave-us-too-much-to-handle.html&title=20%20Times%20Chloe%20Grace%20Moretz%20Gave%20Us%20Too%20Much%20To%20Handle" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-times-chloe-grace-moretz-gave-us-too-much-to-handle.html&description=20%20Times%20Chloe%20Grace%20Moretz%20Gave%20Us%20Too%20Much%20To%20Handle" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-times-chloe-grace-moretz-gave-us-too-much-to-handle.html&title=20%20Times%20Chloe%20Grace%20Moretz%20Gave%20Us%20Too%20Much%20To%20Handle" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f20-times-chloe-grace-moretz-gave-us-too-much-to-handle.html&title=20%20Times%20Chloe%20Grace%20Moretz%20Gave%20Us%20Too%20Much%20To%20Handle" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f20-times-chloe-grace-moretz-gave-us-too-much-to-handle.html&text=20%20Times%20Chloe%20Grace%20Moretz%20Gave%20Us%20Too%20Much%20To%20Handle" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f20-times-chloe-grace-moretz-gave-us-too-much-to-handle.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-07-04</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./blac-chyna-ready-to-take-on-rob-kardashian-over-custody-of-child.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Blac Chyna Ready To Take On Rob Kardashian Over Custody Of Child</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./who-is-the-richest-jennifer-in-hollywood.html><h3>Who Is The Richest Jennifer In Hollywood? >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
