In its debut appearance on the 9th episode of the 15th season, founders <b>Kirsten Maitland and Fred Zwar</b> presented their gourmet vegan cheeses to a panel of wealthy celebrity investors known as the Sharks. This opportunity allowed Rebel Cheese to showcase its innovative plant-based cheeses to a wide audience.</p><p>Despite initial skepticism about the company’s $15 million valuation, the Sharks showed genuine interest in Rebel Cheese’s unique product. The founders skillfully pitched their vision and highlighted the exceptional taste and quality of their vegan cheeses. Mark Cuban and Lori Greiner, two of the influential Sharks, recognized the potential and offered a compelling deal.</p><p>“Mark Cuban and Lori Greiner made an offer of $750,000 for 10% equity in Rebel Cheese. The founders were thrilled and accepted this joint offer, acknowledging the value that both investors would bring to the table. It was a significant moment for Rebel Cheese as they secured the funding and expertise needed to propel their business forward.”</p><p>The positive response from the Sharks and the subsequent deal had a transformative impact on Rebel Cheese’s business. They experienced a surge in sales and gained widespread <b>recognition in the market</b>. The exposure from Shark Tank significantly contributed to their post-show success.</p><h2>The Story Behind Rebel Cheese</h2><p>Kirsten Maitland and Fred Zwar, a husband-and-wife team, are the founders of Rebel Cheese, a renowned brand in the vegan cheese industry. What started as a personal journey towards veganism quickly transformed into a mission to create mouthwatering, plant-based cheeses that could rival their dairy counterparts.</p><p>Driven by Kirsten’s overnight decision to give up cheese after learning about the health risks associated with dairy products, the couple embarked on a mission to develop their own line of artisan vegan cheeses. Collaborating with dairy specialists, they honed their craft and perfected their recipes to create a range of exceptional vegan cheeses.</p><p>Rebel Cheese’s artisan cheeses are crafted from simple yet flavorful ingredients like cashews, water, salt, and cultures. Through careful experimentation and dedication to their craft, Kirsten and Fred achieved a creamy texture and mouthwatering taste that rival traditional dairy cheeses. But what sets Rebel Cheese apart is its commitment to being cholesterol-free and entirely plant-based, making it a healthier and cruelty-free alternative.</p><p>For Kirsten and Fred, Rebel Cheese is more than just a business; it’s a mission to provide people with delicious and healthy alternatives to traditional dairy products. Their creations appeal not only to vegans but also to those seeking sustainable and ethical food options that don’t compromise on taste and quality.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rebel-Cheese-founders-Kirsten-Maitland-and-Fred-Zwar-1024x585.jpg alt="Rebel Cheese founders Kirsten Maitland and Fred Zwar" title="Rebel Cheese founders Kirsten Maitland and Fred Zwar" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Rebel Cheese’s Response to COVID-19</h2><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, businesses had to quickly adapt to the new normal. Rebel Cheese, a renowned vegan cheese brand, was no exception. With a strong commitment to serving their customers and maintaining a consistent customer experience, Rebel Cheese swiftly implemented several changes to ensure their operations continued smoothly.</p><p>One of the key adjustments Rebel Cheese made was shifting their operations online. Recognizing the importance of e-commerce in the current landscape, they revamped their website and launched <b>online operations</b> to cater to their customers’ needs. This transition allowed them to reach a wider audience and offer their products to cheese enthusiasts nationwide.</p><p>To make up for the lack of in-person cheese sampling, Rebel Cheese came up with a creative solution: <b>virtual cheese sampling</b>. Leveraging technology, they brought the tasting experience directly to their customers’ homes. Through interactive online sessions, cheese lovers could explore the unique flavors and textures of Rebel Cheese’s artisan vegan cheeses, guided by knowledgeable cheese experts.</p><p>“Even though we couldn’t physically gather for cheese tasting events, we wanted to create an immersive and engaging experience for our customers. <b>Virtual cheese sampling</b> allowed us to connect with cheese enthusiasts from all over while providing them the opportunity to discover the deliciousness of our cheeses,” said Kirsten Maitland, co-founder of Rebel Cheese.</p><p>Another significant change Rebel Cheese made was the relocation of their manufacturing facility. By moving to a larger space, they optimized their production capacity and streamlined their operations. This move not only allowed for increased productivity but also resulted in significant cost savings, which were then passed on to their valued customers.</p><p>Throughout these challenging times, Rebel Cheese remained unwavering in their commitment to meet the increasing demand for their products.
