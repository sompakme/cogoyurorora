Whether they are genetically part of you or not, your kids are your kids and will remain so till kingdom come. We now know of so many celebrities who have adopted children – think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viola Davis</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Kidman</a>, and many other.</p><p>But did you know that many celebs themselves have been adoptive children? While some were adopted by grandparents or family friends, many were actually adopted at birth and knew their biological parents only once they grew up. Perhaps these celebrities became who they were because of their adoption and the support they received from their adoptive families.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blood may be thicker than water, but sometimes it does fail too. This is when people with big hearts and open minds step in to become foster and adoptive families, making the world a better place, bit by bit. So here are 15 celebrities you may not have known had been adopted, and who made a mark on this world by being who they were. We’d like to think that being adopted was perhaps the best thing that ever happened to them – and it gave them the happy childhood every kid so rightfully deserved. For being loved is every kid’s birthright and it what makes them secure and loving individuals later – experts called it learned behavior – being adopted simply equals being loved!</p><h2 id=michael-bay-adopted-at-birth-but-considers-spielberg-amp-bruckheimer-to-be-his-mentors><strong>Michael Bay: Adopted At Birth But Considers Spielberg & Bruckheimer To Be His Mentors</strong></h2><p>You know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Bay</a> as the directors of the hit Transformers franchise and he credits his success to his two “dad” mentors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Bruckheimer</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Spielberg</a>!</p><p>Michael was adopted when he was a small baby by Harriet, a bookstore owner and child psychiatrist, and Jim, a Certified Public Accountant. His parents later also adopted a baby girl. Michael Bay managed to trace his biological mother and while things indicated that his birth father may be the director John Frankenheimer, Frankenheimer denies this and Bay does not insist on it; and tests proved otherwise too. So while Bay does not know his biological father, in his career Bay has two “dads” who share his creative DNA: Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg, and he has repaid their support rather handsomely too with many a hit that the audience loves to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bill-clinton-adopted-by-his-step-father-who-did-him-no-favours><strong>Bill Clinton: Adopted By His Step-Father Who Did Him No Favours</strong></h2><p>The 42nd President of the United States was kind of adopted too. Born <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">William Jefferson Blythe III</a> in Hope, Arkansas, in 1946 – Bill’s mother became widowed before his birth when his traveling salesman father died in an accident three months before his birth. His mom then moved to New Orleans to study nursing to better support herself and left her baby boy with his grandparents, her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy who raised him till he was four. His mother returned four years later and then married Roger Clinton, Sr., and they moved to Hot Springs in 1950.</p><p>While the Clinton surname was used for Bill almost immediately after the marriage, it was not till he turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.

Her thinness too has been in the limelight, though the media was reportedly informed later that she was hypoglycemic but not anorexic or bulimic.</p><p>Biologically, she was born to Peter Michael Escovedo and Karen Moss but her parents gave her up when she was three into the care of their friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lionel Richie</a> (Peter often played percussion for Lionel) since they were unable to support her financially. While Lionel was first her guardian, he and his then-wife Brenda Harvey legally adopted her when she was nine. Just when the adoption got formalized, Lionel’s affair with Diane Alexander became public knowledge. As a result, Nicole was spoiled silly, and in an interview, Nicole later stated, “Their way of making me happy was to say, 'yes,' to everything I wanted, but I don't think a little girl should have that much freedom.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jamie-foxx-adopted-and-raised-by-his-maternal-grandparents><strong>Jamie Foxx: Adopted And Raised By His Maternal Grandparents</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Foxx</a> was born Eric Marlon Bishop was born in Terrell, Texas on December 13, 1967, to Darrell Bishop, a stockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon.

He is trying to bridge the gap between him and his estranged parents though – and has had a measure of success with his birth mother Louise, especially since he has moved her into his own home.

It was never something that was hidden from me and it is not something I have ever been ashamed of. I recognize how fortunate I am to have parents who love and support me unconditionally. The fact that they are not my biological parents does not change the fact that they are simply, my parents. I count myself lucky to have a birth mother who loved me enough to know she wasn’t ready to be a mom. I’m lucky that I have wonderful parents who chose me.

While Mandela’s father was destined to be chief, a dispute with the local magistrate made him lose his power and stature and they lived in poverty, moving to a tiny village, Qunu, till Mandela was nine, and this is when his father died of lung disease.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is when he was officially adopted by Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo, the acting regent of the Thembu people. Years ago Mandela’s father had recommended Jongintaba be made chief and so the chief now returned the favor – educating Mandela like his own son, and later even making him a counselor. When his adoptive father decided to get him married as was his right, Nelson broke free and ran away – settling down in Johannesburg.

Named John Winston Lennon, Lennon’s father Alfred regularly sent paychecks home but those too stopped in February 1944. When he returned six months later, Lennon’s mom was already pregnant with another man’s child and refused to stay with Alfred.

But his mother is the one who secretly bought him a guitar and helped fuel his love for music.

She was born Norma Jean Mortensen on June 1, 1926, to a mentally unstable mother and no one really knew who her father was. Her childhood was one journey after another in foster homes and orphanages. Gladys was mentally and financially incapable and so Norma stayed with foster parents until&nbsp;she was seven. Stability seemed to come in 1933 when her mother bought a house and took Marilyn to live with her but soon had a mental breakdown – so Marilyn became a ward of the state.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gladys's best friend, Grace, became Norma's guardian, but when she got married, Norma was sent to the Los Angeles Orphans Home and then more foster homes. She returned to live with Grace and her husband “Doc” who then attempted to sexually assault her. To save her, Grace sent Norma to live with her great-aunt Olive in California where Olive's son assaulted her. She was packed off to another aunt who was ill so it was back to Grace and her husband in 1942. By now Norma was 16, and in a relationship with a neighbor's son, Jim Dougherty and they were both soon married off.

Liotta finally located his biological mother and has one half-brother, five half-sisters, and a full sister and remains thankful for his subsequent adoption – since his mother did not really have the means to raise him.

Scheible quietly went to a doctor to give birth to her child and then gave him up for adoption – while originally he was to be adopted by a rich white-collar family – they changed their mind and the baby boy was then given to Paul Reinhold Jobs and&nbsp;Clara Jobs, a blue-collar couple with little money but a lot of love.

While the couple had eight children, only George and his younger sister Mamie survived infancy – six of his siblings died.
