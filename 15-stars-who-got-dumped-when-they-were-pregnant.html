If anything, at times, they can be worse for celebrities because their breakups are public. These breakups could be significantly worse if there's a pregnancy involved. What makes two people break up while one is pregnant? Shockingly enough, it’s usually because of another woman. These situations can certainly be traumatic for all those that are involved, especially the one being dumped. You might be surprised to hear that there are a lot of celebrities who broke up during a pregnancy. Does that seem shocking to you? Tune in to see the couples that went through these experiences. Some of them involve embarrassing situations, while others just make you want to shake your head.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These famous men don’t come off looking very good because they left their girlfriends when they needed them the most, especially the ones that who for another woman. Some of the women saw it coming, while others were blindsided by the news. These relationships were ended at a very dramatic time, and because of that, it hit the news.</p><p>You may feel for these women if you've ever gone through a breakup, especially one that you didn’t see coming. You may be shocked to see the women who got dumped, as some of them are famous actresses, while others are beautiful supermodels. Check out these celebrity breakups, and thank your lucky stars that you were never dumped in this fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bridget-moynahan-and-tom-brady><strong>Bridget Moynahan and Tom Brady</strong></h2><p>This was probably one of the more talked about breakups at the time mainly because there were some big names involved. NFL quarterback <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Brady</a> was dating the hottie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridget Moynahan</a> from movies such as Coyote Ugly and I Robot. They had been dating for three years before they broke up in 2006. A month after the breakup, Bridget broke the bad news to Brady, telling him that she was pregnant. It came as a shock to her that he had already moved on with Supermodel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gisele Bundchen</a> and wasn’t interested in getting back together. There were rumors that maybe Brady was already with Bundchen while they were together since he moved on so quickly. Moynahan was asked about her feelings about Brady and her response was telling, "[Tom] was not in the [delivery] room. He was there on that day and came in afterward. He certainly wasn't holding my hand while I pushed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-milian-and-the-dream><strong>Christina Milian and The-Dream</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina Milian</a> got pregnant while dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The-Dream</a>, and the two broke up just nine days before she gave birth to their daughter. It turned out that it was The-Dream that filed for divorce in February 2010, though they managed to keep it a secret until July. Their breakup was one of the ugliest we’ve seen. Although The-Dream was the one that filed for divorce, he was apparently so distraught over the breakup of his marriage that he tried to commit suicide. Though he seemed to be distraught over the whole breakup, he didn’t seem to have much interest in his child. He has said in interviews that he “didn’t help out much raising the little girl.” Allegations of cheating came out about The-Dream, and Milian was disgusted that she was served divorce papers when she was nine months pregnant. They finally came to an agreement during the fall of that year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heidi-klum-and-flavio-briatore><strong>Heidi Klum and Flavio Briatore</strong></h2><p>Sure, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flavio Briatore</a> is a wealthy Italian businessman, but in our opinion, he was lucky that supermodel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidi Klum</a> dated a man that age and who wasn’t the best-looking guy out there. But for whatever reason, the two became a couple. Strangely, though, Briatore dumped Klum the moment he found out that she was pregnant. She went on to become involved with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seal</a>, who was happy to adopt her daughter. Does Briatore regret letting go of Klum and his daughter? Apparently not. "Leni is my natural daughter, but the three of us happily agreed that it made more sense if Seal adopted her because a child needs to grow up in a family." He told this to an Italian newspaper called II Corriere Della Sera and went on to say, "Heidi, Seal and I have built an amazing relationship. It's hard to miss a baby that you never see. But I know that Leni is not an abandoned child." The child now goes by Seal’s last name, Samuel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shar-jackson-and-kevin-federline><strong>Shar Jackson and Kevin Federline</strong></h2><p>Everyone was shocked when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears</a> started dating one of her backup dancers, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Federline</a>, in 2004. But what was more shocking was when it came out that Federline had been dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shar Jackson</a> when he met Spears and that she was pregnant with his child. So, what seemed like an innocent new relationship turned out to show that Federline dumped his pregnant girlfriend when he realized he had a shot with the famous Britney Spears. Spears and Federline quickly got married and started to make babies of their own. The whole thing must've been devastating to Jackson, who didn’t see any of it coming. She spoke about her breakup with Federline saying that it "wasn't like just breaking up a relationship. It was breaking up a family." The situation grew quite ugly for many years, but Jackson and Federline have since made peace probably because he and Spears divorced as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-louise-parker-and-billy-crudup><strong>Mary-Louise Parker and Billy Crudup</strong></h2><p>This was another high-profile breakup that caused many scandalous headlines. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Louise Parker</a> was dating longtime boyfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy Crudup</a> when she was dumped. Parker was pregnant at the time, and it turned out that Crudup hooked up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire Danes</a> and was leaving his pregnant girlfriend for Danes. Parker was devastated but didn’t talk much about the breakup until she wrote her memoir, Dear Mr. You. Part of her memoir had an apology letter to a cabbie, which many people thought was strange, but it was all connected to her breakup with Crudup. Apparently, during a cab ride, she flipped out on the driver because he got them lost. "I am alone. Look, see? I am pregnant and alone. It hurts even to breathe…" That sure sounds devastating. Danes and Crudup only stayed together for four years afterward, and Danes got some slack for breaking up a happy couple. Despite that, though, Danes didn’t seem fazed at all. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern</a> in an interview, "I was just in love with him and needed to explore that, and I was 24… I didn't quite know what those consequences would be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mel-b-amp-eddie-murphy><strong>Mel B & Eddie Murphy</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Murphy</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel B</a>&nbsp;seemed like a pretty hot item, that was, until Murphy dumped the former Spice Girl when she was pregnant with his child. He went so far as to deny that the child was his until she forced him to do a paternity test that ruled he was the father. To make matters worse, he waited three more years before he would become part of his child’s life. It certainly didn’t make him look very good when news got out of their breakup. Mel B found the breakup to be devastating, as she made it clear that she was in love with Murphy. There were even rumors going around at the time that claimed that despite his behavior, Mel B still wanted Murphy to come back. A friend told interviewers, "Even after the way he has treated her and snubbed his own daughter, I think Mel would still take him back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denise-richards-and-charlie-sheen><strong>Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Denise Richards</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Sheen</a> had a long-term relationship and already had one child together. But during Richards' second pregnancy, the two split up, and divorce papers were filed. Documents started surfacing about their divorce, and Richards claimed that Sheen hadn’t wanted their children and that he had tried to convince her to terminate her previous pregnancy with their older child. She was also claiming that he was verbally and physically abusive towards her. Apparently, the documents are quite brutal, so it was no wonder that Richards wanted out of the marriage. Sheen came back with a comment that Richards’s filing was "immature and a transparent smear campaign designed to hurt, embarrass and ultimately extort" him. Their marriage did end, and Richards has sole custody of their two children, though Sheen does see them. The two have since decided to get along for the sake of the children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-rutherford-and-daniel-giersch><strong>Kelly Rutherford and Daniel Giersch</strong></h2><p>We know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Rutherford</a> as the matriarch in Gossip Girl, though she's had a strong career in Hollywood beyond that. She went through a bitter divorce and custody battle with her former husband, German businessman Daniel Giersch, that lasted almost ten years. The divorce came as a shock to everyone because it happened shortly after the happy couple announced their second pregnancy in 2008. Rutherford filed for divorce just a month after announcing she was pregnant. The battle became international because Giersch took the children to Monaco. After the long battle, people were surprised when Giersch was awarded full custody, and he took the kids to Monaco where they spend most of their time. Rutherford’s brother, however, thought there was always something wrong with Giersch, and in the end, it turned out that she was right, “He seemed very, very cold and calculated,” her half-brother says. “But I love my sister, and if this guy was going to make her happy, I was not going to be the one to bring up any negativity.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelis-and-nas><strong>Kelis and Nas</strong></h2><p>Rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nas</a> and “Milkshake” singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelis</a> have a long history together as well as having a child together. The two split when Kelis was pregnant with their second child. Nas mentioned in an interview that the relationship was pretty over before the second pregnancy, but the two were trying to make it work. "There was a point where we were trying to hold onto a relationship that was finished. She was pregnant and in the studio while we were recording 'Distant Relatives,' and he would move when the music would come on. That was a great feeling for me, just to have that feeling of family. It ended around the time the record was being done." Kelis, however, didn’t agree with his side of things.

At the time, she was pregnant with twins and actually on doctor-ordered bed rest. She was devastated by the split up but more so because while she was on bed rest and pregnant with their children, Barber was having an affair with a blonde woman who was ten years younger than his wife. It came as a shock to him when she filed for divorce, though he probably should've seen it coming. The couple already had two children together when she filed before her twins were even born. To make matters worse, the divorce went on for another two years because the two argued over money.

Diplo, who is a producer and DJ, stated that the two were in an off-again-on-again relationship and were actually “off” when Lockhart informed him that she was pregnant. Diplo had even moved on at that point and was dating the singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a>. That couple didn’t last very long either; they broke up right after Lockhart had given birth. Although there was talk that Diplo and Lockhart might reunite, it never happened.

Having children wasn’t part of Bing’s plan, however, and he dumped Hurley and even claimed that the child wasn't his. He said he would provide for the child if a DNA test proved he was the father. Hurley was furious and denied any money from Bing. Bing claimed that Hurley had tricked him into getting pregnant and then wouldn’t terminate the child when he asked her to. After the birth of the child, it was proven that it was Bing’s, and he offered to pay her a large sum of money, which Hurley refused. A source familiar with the case revealed, "Steve has always said that he would be generous if Damian turned out to be his son, and he was happy to agree to pay £100,000 ($123,000) a year to his upkeep. The money is for Damian, not Liz.

He was seeing her all through the divorce proceedings, and it looked like the two would continue seeing each other after. There were rumors that the divorce was because of Tomlinson and that he was going to keep dating her after that. Things changed, though, when she came to Wahlberg and told him that she was pregnant, and he proceeded to dump her, too. Gone with the wife and the mistress all in one swoop! Wahlberg apparently went ballistic when he heard the news of Tomlinson's pregnancy and had no intention of staying with her.

It wasn’t until their child was four years old that she revealed that the father was Lea. "I don't need to protect him anymore," she told the Observer (via the Daily Mail). "He can fend for himself. He's a grown-up." She added, "Our relationship was very complicated and private, and I honestly didn't want to have to talk about it. I didn't want people coming up to him… and raising eyebrows."

Hartwell made it perfectly clear that it was the pregnancy itself that caused him to file for divorce and that he also wanted a paternity test. "’She wanted a baby really fast, and what I was trying to explain to her was that… when you first get married, especially since we didn't have a long courtship, that we should actually focus on each other and not just have a baby."
